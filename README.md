# MedievalCombatTournament

Medieval Combat Tournament is a piece of software that simulates a medieval combat tournament, with entrants of
different physical parameters and weapon choices.  The entrants have two physical parameters
-- strength, reach, and speed.  The weapons have three archetypes -- long, medium, and short.
Each weapon, regardless of archetype, has a defense and an offense bonus.  To win a match in
the tournament, a fighter must score 10 points of damage on his opponent.
The purpose of this program will be to create, record, and print an entertaining combat record to
the console that shows the unique strengths of each kind of weapon.  To facilitate this, each
tournament shall have an associated Jester who will comment on the progress and outcome of
a match.
A tournament will consist of 4 sub-tournaments -- a long-weapon tournament, a
medium-weapon tournament, a short-weapon tournament, and a wild tournament where
contestants may use any weapon they choose
